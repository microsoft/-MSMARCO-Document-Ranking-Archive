# MS MARCO Document Ranking Leaderboard Archive

This is a work-in-progress attempt to revamp the MS MARCO Document Ranking Leaderboard.
We will "switch over" to this repo at some future point, but until then, [the main MS MARCO site](https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/) remains the "ground truth".

## Submission Instructions

To make a submission, please follow these instructions:

1. Decide on a submission id, which will be a permanent unique key. The submission id should be of the form `YYYYMMDD-foo`, where `foo` can be a suffix of your choice, e.g., your group's name.
Please keep the length reasonable.
See [here](https://github.com/microsoft/MSMARCO-Document-Ranking-Archive/tree/main/submissions) for examples.
`YYYYMMDD` should correspond to the submission date of your run.

2. Create the directory `submissions/YYYYMMDD-foo/`. This directory should contain three files:
   1. `submissions/YYYYMMDD-foo/dev.txt.bz2` - run file on the dev queries, bz2-compressed
   2. `submissions/YYYYMMDD-foo/eval.txt.bz2` - run file on the eval queries, bz2-compressed
   3. `submissions/YYYYMMDD-foo-metadata.json`, in the following format:

       ```
        {
          "team": "team name",
          "model_description": "model description",
          "date": "yyyyy/mm/dd",       // submission date
          "paper": "url",              // URL to paper
          "code": "url",               // URL to code
          "type": "full ranking"       // either 'full ranking' or 'reranking'
        }
       ```

3. Run our evaluation script to make sure everything is in order (and fix any errors):
   ```bash
   $ python eval/run_eval.py --id YYYYMMDD-foo
   ```

4. Package (i.e., encrypt) the submission using the following script:
   ```bash
   $ eval/pack.sh YYYYMMDD-foo
   ```

5. Open a pull request against this repository.
The subject (title) of the pull request should be "Submission YYYYMMDD-foo", where `YYYYMMDD-foo` is the submission id you decided on.
This pull request should contain exactly three files:
   1. `submissions/YYYYMMDD-foo.key.bin.enc` - the encrypted key
   2. `submissions/YYYYMMDD-foo.tar.enc` - the encrypted tarball
   3. `submissions/YYYYMMDD-foo-metadata.json.enc` - the encrypted metadata
